## Preface

The goal of this project is to implement an application called `portfolio-app` to manage projects and blogs. This 
project uses [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) as a back-end web framework and 
[React](https://react.dev/) as a front-end library application. Besides, it uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) as database and cloud storage respectively.
